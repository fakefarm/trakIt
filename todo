Checkout:
 ☐ make checkout show - 'assignment history'
 ☐ add tags to assignment show
 ☐ convert checkouts to assignments


Items:
 ☐ at asset level, have counts based on status
 ☐ Add waranty end to item / asset level, not serial number
 ☐ asset / item should have - make, model, warranty, title



New Item workflow idea:
 ☐ New Item has bundle auto complete, and assets in bundle
 ☐ select existing asset via autofill, or make a new one if none exists there.


Where to put comments:
 ☐ remove tags and use those as comments, just different fields;  tag, comment, status
 ☐ checkout#show

 ☐ item#show
 ☐ SerialNumber#show

Serial Numbers:
 ☐ make serial numbers have status
 ☐ make serial_level show - the 'asset history'
 ☐ add tags to serial show

Next Steps:
 ☐ review zen desk api
 ☐ review autocomplete

Bundle:
☐ move trackable to bundle level
